# External meetings

External meetings are typically scheduled and managed by one or more partners. All meetings are scheduled on our respective [Google Calendars](../remote-work#google-calendar).

## Calendly

DataMade uses [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to schedule meetings with clients and other people outside DataMade. Calendly syncs directly with Google Calendar and removes a lot of the back & forth work typically spent finding available times to meet.

All DataMade Partners and Staff have their own Calendly accounts. For documentation on how to create multi-person Calendly events, see the Calendly instructions on [How to set host availability for multi-person scheduling](https://help.calendly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045209313-How-to-set-host-availability-for-multi-person-scheduling).
