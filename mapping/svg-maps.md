# About SVG files
SVG files, or scalable vector graphic files, are a unique image type that work well for making maps. Maps made with SVG files allow us access to the discrete geographies within the map using JavaScript, which also opens up client-side map rendering. This makes SVG maps a powerful tool when working with front-end frameworks like React.js.

## SVG Maps
In order to build an SVG map, you first need to find an open-source SVG image of the map you want to use. The first place you can look is the [`svg-maps`](https://github.com/VictorCazanave/svg-maps) repo, which complements the [`react-svg-map`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg-map) repo. These repos provide functionality for using SVG maps with React. If the map you want to use is not already a part of the `svg-maps` repository, [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=filemime%3Aimage%2Fsvg%2Bxml&title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&fulltext=1&advancedSearch-current=%7B%22fields%22%3A%7B%22filetype%22%3A%22image%2Fsvg%2Bxml%22%7D%7D&ns6=1) is a good place to start looking for an SVG map.

Keep in mind that since SVG files are geometric representations of the image, understanding how to read an SVG file can help you edit it so that it meets your needs. [This article](https://www.sitepoint.com/svg-101-what-is-svg/) provides a bit more context about what SVG files are, and [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/svg-circle-decomposition-paths/) explains how to manually calculate the path of a circle, which will expose you to some basic SVG concepts that will allow you to tweak your SVG file. It’s also easier to remove lines than to add them in most cases, so if you’re deciding between an SVG map that is too simple and one that is too complex, opting for the complex one will usually be the better choice.

If the map you need is not in the `svg-maps` repo, you can still use it in your code (and submit to the `svg-maps` repo with your shiny new SVG map!) These are the steps to do so:
1. Download the `svg-maps` repository and follow the instructions to generate a JSON representation of the SVG map.
2. If you wish to contribute to the `svg-maps` repository, follow all the instructions in that README to format your map consistently with the other maps available.
3. Copy the JSON file into your project repository and add it to the `images` folder in your React or Gatsby project.
4. Use [this proof of concept](https://github.com/fatima3558/gatsby-svg-map) as a guide to render your SVG map, paying particular attention to the `src/images/svg/` directory and the `USMap` component.

Once you have your JSON version of the SVG map, you can treat this like any other props and build a map component using the `react-svg-map` package. This package takes your map’s geographies and allows you to pass props into each of the geometries programmatically.
