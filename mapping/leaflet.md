# Leaflet
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source JavaScript library for highly interactive, mobile-friendly maps.

There are two ways to use Leaflet:
1. [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for plain JavaScript projects.
2. [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/), which is for React projects. [See our documentation](/mapping/react-leaflet.md) for some guidance on how to use it.

## Leaflet with vanilla JS
The Leaflet library is a tool to use when:
1. you need a ["slippy map"](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map)
2. your map has a lot of interactions, more than you can manage with an SVG
3. you have some GeoJSON or custom geographical features

[The Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/) is the best place to learn the basics of Leaflet.
