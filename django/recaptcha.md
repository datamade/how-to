# Set up Google reCAPTCHA in a Django app
Google's reCAPTCHA protects public-facing forms from the bots (like a sign up form). This guide will walk you through how to set up a production-ready V2 reCAPTCHA in a Django/Docker/Heroku application. See [the reCAPTCHA documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro) for more details about reCAPTCHA itself.

Each application requires a unique reCAPTCHA. Anytime you want to add a reCAPTCHA to your app, you'll need to create a new one for production. In addition to your unique reCAPTCHA, Google provides a test reCAPTCHA that you can use for automated testing and local development. 

You'll first implement the test reCAPTCHA. Once this is setup, it will be easy to reconfigure your application to use a real reCAPTCHA.

- [Create a "throwaway" reCAPTCHA for testing](#create-a-throwaway-recaptcha-for-testing)
- [Add a production reCAPTCHA](#add-a-production-recaptcha)

## How it works
- A user fills out a form with the reCAPTCHA, then submits the form. Google provides some JavaScript to help with this.
- The view validates the form and the reCAPTCHA, separately.
  - The form fields are validated like any regular Django form.
  - To validate the reCAPTCHA, the view POSTs the user's reCAPTCHA response to Google's reCAPTCHA API.
  - Depending on Google's response, the reCAPTCHA is valid or invalid.

## Set up the test reCAPTCHA
First, you'll need to setup the test reCAPTCHA within your application. The test reCAPTCHA should not be used in a production environment, because the validation always evaluates to true (aka not a bot).

### Configure the keys
1. Get the public key and secret key for Google's test reCAPTCHA. You can [get the keys from their site](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/faq#id-like-to-run-automated-tests-with-recaptcha.-what-should-i-do).


2. Add the public and private keys to your local environment. 
    - Create an `.env.example` file in your root directory. This will give you a file that can be commited to version control and shared with other developers, so they know what environment variables to set for their own local development. [Here is an example from one of our projects](https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/.env.example#L9), with the keys for Google's test reCAPTCHA.
    - Once you have your `.env.example` file, copy it to a local `.env` file so that your application can use the environment variables.

3. Configure docker-compose to use the environment file
    - Reference the `.env` file in the project's root `docker-compose.yml` file. This will enable the app to run locally and use your local environment variables. [Here is an example](https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/docker-compose.yml#L26).
    - If your tests interact with the reCAPTCHA, then add the environment variables to [`~/tests/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/tests/docker-compose.yml#L13).

Now you can use the public key and private key in your code.

### Implement your code
There are a few ways of doing this, so [refer to Google](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro) when considering how to do this in your project. For this guide, we are implementing V2 of reCAPTCHA.

1. Configure the view with the public key. [Pass the public key into the template via the context](https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/parserator_web/views.py#L519).

2. Add Google's magic JavaScript and public key to your template.
    -  We have [an example of how this looks](https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/parserator_web/templates/parserator_web/sign_up.html#L53) in an application. [See Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display#auto_render) for other ways to do this, too.

3. Write a helper function to validate the reCAPTCHA with Google's API. Your backend needs to accept the reCAPTCHA response from the frontend, and then send a request to Google to validate the reCAPTCHA response. 
    - Here's an example of how we've done this with V2: https://github.com/datamade/parserator.datamade.us/blob/bda3201c3d7873916ed4075a2102b5805fad9a3a/parserator_web/views.py#L524.
    - Here's another example of this with V3: https://github.com/datamade/django-salsa-auth/commit/c8512d030b90762c7d703bfd1630f79d11e10a5e#diff-bfb393f3e832ecb2f6fb86ad35eefa88a87e0d773b3e4a80ce224d83997df815R137

5. Test it manually and automatically. If everything was setup correctly, then you should be able submit the form. 

By this point, everything should be working in your app so that you can change out the test keys and use a real reCAPTCHA.

## Create a throwaway reCAPTCHA for testing
If you want to test a real reCAPTCHA, then you'll need to first create one. You can use this reCAPTCHA to test locally and with a review app deployment.

1. Create the reCAPTCHA. Go to the reCAPTCHA admin site and create a new reCAPTCHA: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create. It should be the v2 type. Add `localhost` as a whitelisted domain.

2. Reconfigure your environment variables. In your `.env` file, change the public and private key. Add the keys from the reCAPTCHA you just created.

3.  Test it. This is where you might need to do some debugging. Good luck!

## Add a production reCAPTCHA
Get with a project lead to create a new, official reCAPTCHA for your app. [Follow the steps from the previous section](#create-a-throwaway-recaptcha-for-testing) to create this. This one should be used for staging and production environments. 

1. Create a new reCAPTCHA. Be sure to whitelist the proper domains.
2. Get the public and private keys for the new reCAPTCHA.
3. Set Heroku environment variables with those keys.
4. Deploy to Heroku with environment variables.
5. Test that it works.
6. Bye Bye Bots.
